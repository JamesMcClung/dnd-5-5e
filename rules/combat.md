## Flanking
Flanking would be a pseudo-condition that grants +2 bonus to melee attacks against the flanked target. Two allies are said to be flanking a creature if the allies are not incapacitated, on opposite sides of the creature, and adjacent to the creature. 

Certain creatures (those with blindsight, tremorsense, or multiple heads) would be immune to flanking.
